## Key Insights

### 1. Gender Breakdown by Job Level
**Overview:**  
- The data shows that men dominate at higher job levels, especially in management and executive roles. Although there is a more balanced representation at junior levels, the gender gap widens significantly as job levels increase.


### 2. Promotion Trends by Gender
**Overview:**  
- Promotion rates between males and females in FY21 are relatively balanced, but there is still a slight disparity favoring male employees in certain promotion decisions. Women make up a smaller proportion of the promotion base group.


### 3. New Hire Trends by Gender
**Overview:**  
- New hires in FY20 were more balanced, with women making up a significant proportion of new recruits. This shows that initial recruitment efforts are contributing to a more diverse workforce at entry levels.


### 4. Gender Distribution in the Promotion Base Group for FY21
**Overview:**  
- Men make up the majority of the base group eligible for promotion in FY21. This suggests that fewer women are in positions to be considered for upward mobility, potentially due to slower career progression or limited access to leadership roles.


### 5. Performance and Age Distribution by Gender
**Overview:**  
- The average performance rating for female employees is slightly higher than for males, yet women still face slower upward mobility. Additionally, the average age of female employees is slightly younger, which may suggest less time in the workforce or fewer years of experience at the company.

### 4. Monitor and Evaluate Diversity Progress Regularly
Regularly analyze diversity data to track progress and identify areas where gender imbalances persist. Implement diversity dashboards to monitor key metrics such as promotion rates, retention, and career progression by gender.

### 5. Leadership Development for Women
